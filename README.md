# ChessVision
An application that can detect and analyse a position on a real chessboard via a smartphone camera. I'm simply interested to see if I can improve on the ideas [Maciej A. Czyzewski](https://github.com/maciejczyzewski/neural-chessboard), [Jailin Ding](https://github.com/jialinding/ChessVision), and [Daylen Yang](https://github.com/jialinding/ChessVision).


## Technology
Nothing is set in stone but I predict a blend of OpenCV, Tensorflow, Stockfish, and whatever I need for the OSX and Android SDKs.

## High-level Plan
Coming soon.
